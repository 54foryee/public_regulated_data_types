# A generic air data computer (ADC) service.
#
# An air data computer service is generally a non-interactive publish-only service: when activated,
# it keeps publishing its measurements at a fixed rate over several subjects until deactivated.
# The activation/deactivation, if supported, is managed via the standard arming command service.
# The data update rates and other parameters are controlled via the Register API using implementation-defined
# register names.
#
# An ADC whose arming state is SLEEP is allowed to cease all network activity.
#
# An ADC whose arming state is DISARMED is recommended to behave as if its state was ARMED;
# implementations are recommended to leverage this state to perform any necessary maintenance activities
# such as calibration, self-heating, etc. The ADC should not report its own status as ARMED until said
# maintenance activities have been completed. Therefore, the high-level controler (e.g., the flight
# management unit) may delay the take-off until the ADC is ready.
#
# An ADC whose arming state is ARMED is required to comply with the requirements set out below.
#
# An armed ADC should publish the following data subjects synchronously at the same configurable rate
# which should not be lower than the specified limit. The measurements should be low-pass filtered
# to avoid frequency aliasing effects.
#
#   PUBLISHED SUBJECT       TYPE                                                NOTE
#   calibrated airspeed     reg.drone.phy.kinematics.trans.Velocity1CovTs
#   true airspeed           reg.drone.phy.kinematics.trans.Velocity1CovTs       optional
#   pressure altitude data  reg.drone.phy.kinematics.trans.LinearCovTs          assume ISA; NED frame (+down, -up)
#   static air data         reg.drone.phy.thermodynamics.PressureTempCovTs      pressure and OAT
#
# Observe that there is no subject for indicated airspeed. This is because per the principles of service-oriented
# design, the ADC is responsible for applying the necessary transformations on its data to render it ready for
# consumption by clients. If desired, indicated airspeed may be reported over an implementation-defined subject.
#
# In addition to the above, an armed ADC should publish the following service subjects at an implementation-defined
# rate that should not be lower than the specified limit:
#
#   PUBLISHED SUBJECT       TYPE
#   heartbeat               reg.drone.srv.common.Heartbeat
#
# Despite being a non-interactive service, an ADC is recommended to subscribe to the arming command subject.
# This recommendation may be omitted if the ADC does not support arming state selection, in which case it should
# always report itself as being ARMED.
#
#   SUBSCRIBED SUBJECT      TYPE
#   arming command          reg.drone.srv.common.Arming
