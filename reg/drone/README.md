# Drone

This namespace contains the application-specific regulated DSDL namespace for aerial vehicles.
If you have any questions, feel free to bring them to the [UAVCAN Forum](https://forum.uavcan.org/c/sig/drone-sig/17).

This namespace contains two nested namespaces:

- `physics` -- abstract physical processes and states in the system.
- `service` -- narrowly specialized types for common device classes.

The motivation for such design is provided in [The UAVCAN Guide](https://uavcan.org/guide),
chapter "Interface Design Guidelines".
