# The electronic speed controller (ESC) service is designed for controlling and monitoring electric drives.
# From the standpoint of this standard, an electric drive is just a special case of a servo. For generality,
# COTS electric drives are recommended to also support the servo interface defined in the adjacent namespace.
#
# ESCs (drives) are segregated into groups. Each ESC in a group has an index that is unique within the group.
# Drives in a group are commanded synchronously by publishing a message containing an array of setpoints.
# There are several subjects defined:
#
#   - Setpoint array subject. Every participant subscribes to the same setpoint subject.
#     Every message is consumed by all participants according to their index in the group.
#     The setpoint subject defines the group. There may be an arbitrary number of such groups in the network.
#
#   - Arming subject. Every participant subscribes to the same arming subject which is used to command the
#     state of the group: sleep, disarmed, or armed. In many cases there will be one global arming subject
#     controlling the state of the entire system; in other cases there will be dedicated arming controls on a
#     per-subsystem basis.
#
#   - Individual subjects, whose subject-ID is offset from the setpoint subject-ID `S` as a function of
#     group member index `i` as specified below.
#
#                                                   SUBJECT     TYPE                                        SUBJECT-ID

#
# Therefore, in order to configure a group member, one has to set up two parameters: the setpoint subject-ID and
# the group member index.
#
# Notice that the physics subjects are timestamped.
#
# Vendor/application-specific subjects are not shown here; their subject-IDs are implementation-defined.
# Vendors are encouraged to publish additional data (e.g., temperatures) on separate subjects.
#
#
#   SETPOINT SUBJECT
#
# The setpoint subject is ignored unless the drive is ARMED. As long as the drive is not ARMED, it shall not apply
# any power to the load excepting non-operational scenarios such as maintenance and diagnostics, which are
# outside of the scope of this service definition. More on arming and safety in the next section.
#
# Upon reception of a setpoint message, a group participant fetches its setpoint from the array using the array
# element whose index equals the index of the group participant. By virtue of the Implicit Zero Extension Rule,
# if the message is too short, the setpoint will be interpreted as zero.
#
# If no valid setpoint was received in CONTROL_TIMEOUT or a lower implementation-specific value,
# the drive should assume a zero setpoint for safety reasons.
# The minimum setpoint publication period should be at least twice lower than its timeout.
#
# While stopped, the drive may either allow the load to freewheel or it may force it to a particular parking position,
# depending on the implementation requirements. The actual state of the load may be continuously reported using the
# dynamics subject. Notice that per the safety rule introduced earlier, the parking position may be impossile
# to enforce unless the drive is ARMED because it may require delivering power to the load.
#
# The setpoint message types that can be used to command a group of drives are defined in
# reg.drone.service.actuator.common.sp; please read the documentation related to that namespace for further information.
# Servo setpoint message types may also be supported on an implementation-specific basis for enhanced interoperability.
# If the group is controlled using different setpoint subjects concurrently, the behavior is implementation-defined.
#
# The following control modes are defined, none of which are mandatory to support.
# The control mode in use is to be specified using the register API.
# This service does not support switching the control mode or setting the motion profile at runtime;
# for that, please refer to the servo service.
#
#   0. Ratiometric voltage control. Each setpoint scalar is a value normalized/saturated in [-1, +1] representing
#      the Q-axis/phase/armature (depending on the type of the drive) voltage as a fraction of the maximum.
#      This control mode emulates the behavior of a typical RCPWM-controlled BLDC drive.
#
#   1. Ratiometric current/torque control. Each setpoint scalar is a value normalized/saturated in [-1, +1] representing
#      the Q-axis/phase/armature (depending on the type of the drive) current as a fraction of the maximum.
#      A negative setpoint during forward rotation (positive during reverse rotation) commands braking.
#
#   2. Speed control. Each setpoint scalar contains the target angular velocity of the load in radian/second.
#
#   -. More control modes may be added later. Which control modes are supported is implementation-defined.
#
# Considerations that apply to all control modes:
#  -  Negative setpoint values represent reversal; a positive setpoint is co-directed with positive rotation/torque.
#  -  If reverse operation is not supported, negative values should be clamped to zero.
#  -  A non-finite setpoint is to be treated as zero.
#
#
#   ARMING SUBJECT
#
# The default state is DISARMED. While disarmed, the drive is not allowed to deliver power to the load,
# and the setpoint subject is ignored. The drive shall enter the disarmed state automatically if the arming subject
# is not updated for CONTROL_TIMEOUT.
#
# While the drive is ARMED, the setpoint commands are processed normally as described in the adjacent section.
# If the drive does not support bidirectional operation, implementations are recommended to ensure that the load
# is driven at some minimum power level (idling) while the drive is armed regardless of the commanded setpoint,
# unless such behavior is deemed incompatible with the functional requirements of the controlled drive.
#
# If the selected arming state is SLEEP, the behavior is implementation-defined. Implementations are recommended to
# power off the high-voltage circuitry and all non-essential components (e.g., LED indication, sensors, etc.)
# to minimize the power consumption.
#
# Implementations are recommended to announce transitions between the arming states using audiovisual feedback.
#
# The worst-case state transition latency is not defined. The controlling element (that is, the unit that publishes
# to the setpoint and arming subjects) is expected to monitor the actual arming status of each component using
# the feedback subject. For example, a sensorless electric motor drive may choose to spool-up before entering the
# ARMED state, which would obviously take time; as soon as the spool-up is finished, the drive would switch its
# reported status from DISARMED to ARMED, thereby indicating that it is ready for normal operation.
#
#
#   PUBLISHED SUBJECTS
#
# The following subjects shall be published immediately after a new setpoint is applied even if the drive is DISARMED:
#
#   SUBJECT             RECOMMENDED PRIORITY
#   ---------------------------------------------
#   feedback            same as the setpoint
#   power               second to the setpoint
#   dynamics            second to the setpoint
#
# If no setpoint is being published, these subjects should continue being updated at least at 1/MAX_PUBLICATION_PERIOD.
# The publication rate requirements do not apply if the arming state is SLEEP.
#
# If the setpoint publication rate exceeds 50 Hz, implementations are allowed (but not required) to throttle these
# subjects by dropping some of the messages such that the publication rate of each subject does not exceed 50 Hz.
# Implementations operating over Classic CAN are recommended to do this.
#
# The other subjects may be published at an implementation-defined rate and priority,
# which should be consistent across the group.
#
# Implementations are encouraged to provide additional subjects for enhanced feedback and monitoring.
#
# The measurements carried by the published messages should be low-pass filtered with an adequate cutoff frequency to
# avoid aliasing effects. Implementations should strive to sample all parameters simultaneously.
#
# If a float-typed reported quantity is unknown, the corresponding value should be NaN.
#
#
#   CONVENTIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS
#
# A drive powers a rotary mechanical load that may be connected via a gearbox. It is the responsibility of
# the drive to account for the gear ratio of the gearbox when calculating related parameters such as angular
# velocity or torque.
#
# It is assumed that there is a well-defined direction of rotation that is referred to as forward rotation.
# A positive angular velocity represents forward rotation. Likewise, forward torque is positive.
#
# It is assumed that the drive is powered from a DC electric power supply network. A positive electric current
# represents current flowing from the network into the drive, also referred to as the state of driving/motoring.
# The opposite -- braking/regeneration -- is represented by negative current.
#
# Excepting edge cases and transients, torque and current are generally of the same sign.
# The above is summarized on the following four-quadrant diagram:
#
#                                   +velocity
#                                       ^
