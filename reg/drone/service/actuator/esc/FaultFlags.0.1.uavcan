# A collection of detailed fault flags indicating problems detected by the service provider.
# A fault flag is set when the corresponding parameter exceeds its safe operating area (SOA) as defined by the vendor;
# see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_operating_area.
# As long as at least one flag is set, the service health should not be NOMINAL.

bool overload
# Output power/current above SOA or regeneration below the SOA.

bool dc_voltage
# DC link voltage above or below the SOA.

bool motor_temperature
bool driver_temperature
# Temperature is above or below the SOA.

bool angular_velocity
# Angular velocity of the load is above or below the SOA.

bool mechanical_fault
# The load cannot be driven due to a mechanical failure.

bool vibration
# The mechanical vibration level exceeds the SOA.

bool configuration
# Configuration is missing or invalid.

void7

bool other
# None of the above (vendor-specific).
